Portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Codes are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and R markdown files.

## Contents
* Machine Learning
  * [Customer segmentation and CLV](https://github.com/dkekre21/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Customer-Segmentation-CLV) identifies   customer types for a durable goods company by analysing the needs and wants. Implements Customer LifetTime Value (CLTV) in order to distinguish customer based on their potential lifetime profits, to aid customer relationship management.
